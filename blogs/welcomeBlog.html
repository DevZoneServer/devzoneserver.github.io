      Hiya there developers! I am Aryan from DevZone. Have you ever felt that you are stuck on a coding problem
      and can't seem to get out of it? Have you ever wondered if your art can be any better? If you are like me
      and always keep questioning yourself about your programs, art, etc. Then DevZone is the best place for you to be.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
      You might be wondering why is it so? Fear not brave developer, i am here to explain just that. At DevZone you
      get to meet people who are developers like you. Some are beggining their journey in the wild, while others, have
      explored the vast dungeons full of bugs. And the best part is all of them want to help you become a better
      developer. And in return, you can also help people who are new to some regions, guide them through the palace of
      Game Design, or the deadly caves of python.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now you might be wondering about your art. Well, to that i must say we have got you covered! There are artists
      and designers who have spent hours trying to perfect their work and are there to guide you to the right direction
      if you ever get lost. You can get feedback on not only art and programming but also music and other creative
      stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      So now stop compalining and hop on the <strong>
        <a href="https://discord.gg/VEdn4yk" class="textUnderline">discord server!</a>
      </strong> Oh the projects? Yeah! We do
      have some community projects
      where we all come together to build something great, and in the adventure encounter many problems, some we
      just
      smack
      with our tiny fingers, while some take a few people to be taken down. But at the end of the journey, we always
      come out with
      the treasure, the knowledge that we gained.
    </p>
